\title{Detecting and Combating ARP Spoofing}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
Since the early days of the computer, the ARP cache has been an easy target for ARP attacks like ARP spoofing. Even until today, it is still relatively easy to carry out an ARP spoofing attack, and remains rather difficult to defend against it. 

Thus, our project aims to create a program for users to actively detect if they are victims of ARP spoofing, and to offer alternative ways to protect themselves.

\section{Introduction}
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is an important protocol in computer network communications. \\ Without this protocol, it would be difficult for computers to \\communicate with each other, because we would not know the MAC address of the computer we are communicating with. Thus, it would be difficult to establish an IP-to-MAC address mapping.

However, it is also one of the easier protocols to carry out attacks on, because of the lack of viable solutions to protect the ARP cache. Some common attacks that can occur after an ARP Spoof are man-in-the-middle (MITM), Denial-of-\\Service (DOS), or even session hijacking. 
In such cases, the security principles of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability may be violated. 
We will be illustrating how an ARP Spoof occurs in Section 2. 

Some common programs which users can use to carry out such an attack include `Ettercap' and `Cain and Abel'. As these programs are open source, almost anyone can easily carry out ARP Spoofing with some basic technical knowledge. 

\section{Background}
In order to understand how ARP spoofing occurs, we will need to cover the basics on how computers communicate with each other. In this section, we will be explaining how computers do so, and introduce the basic notions of how an ARP spoof is carried out. 

\subsection{The TCP/IP Model}
In computer networking, the communication protocols are categorised and organised into different layers. In the TCP/IP Model, there are 5 layers: 

1. Application Layer\\
2. Transport Layer\\
3. Internet Layer\\
4. Link Layer\\
5. Physical Layer\\

DHCP is an application layer protocol and ARP is a link layer protocol.

\subsection{Computer Communications}
In a typical modern computer, all IP addresses are resolved dynamically through the use of the Dynamic Host \\Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This is carried out in the following steps: \\
(to include picture) \\
1. DHCP Discover \\
2. DHCP Offer \\
3. DHCP Request \\
4. DHCP Ack \\ 

After that, assuming everyone has already had their IPs assigned to them via DHCP, suppose the the user Alice wishes to send some information to Bob. The following steps are then carried out: 

1. ARP Request: Alice's computer sends out an ARP request to find out which MAC address has Bob's IP. 

\includegraphics[width=3in]{ARP_Request.eps}

2. When Bob's computer receives the request, he sends back an ARP response packet. 

\includegraphics[width=3in]{ARP_Response.eps}

3. Alice gets the response and stores the corresponding IP-to-MAC entry into the ARP cache. 


\subsection{Poisoning the ARP Cache}
If an attacker, Eve, wishes to carry out an MITM attack on the ARP, this is typically what happens: 

1. Alice's computer sends out an ARP request to find out what is Bob's MAC address. 

2. Before Bob's computer can reply, the attacker, Eve, sends a spam of packets to Alice's computer, claiming to be Bob. The ARP cache then becomes poisoned.

\section{Current Solutions and \\Mitigations}
There are many solutions in the market to combat ARP Spoofing, such as Agnitum Outpost Firewall. However, many of these solutions are described to have major issues. From \cite{vivek:arp}, \cite{navid:arp2} and \cite{goldendeep:arp3},  these are the summaries and drawbacks of current implementations in the market:

1. Use of Cryptographic Techniques \\
Examples: S-ARP 

2. Passive Detection \\
Examples: Agnitum Outpost Firewall

3. Kernel-based patches\\
Examples: Anticap, Antidote 

4. Making MAC entries static\\ 



\section{Goals}
In taking up this project, we hoped to achieve the following goals: 

1. Provide users with a means to actively combat ARP spoofing \\
2. Make any network more secure. \\
3. Provide a GUI for users to see what is happening in their network in real-time. 

\section{Proof of Concept}
\subsection{Implementation System}
Operating System: \\
OSX El Capitan, Arch-Linux [Manjaro 15.12 Capella]

Software: \\
Python 2.7 with the following libraries: scipy, scapy, \\matplotlib, \\ Ettercap \\ Wireshark
\subsection{The Attacker}
In our solution, we used Ettercap to stimulate an ARP Spoofing attack.

\section{Our solution versus current \\solutions}
to insert stuff 

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
Our project has several flaws which we were unable to resolve within a reasonable timeframe: 

1. Our solution will not work on a network that employs WPA-Enterprise level of encryption. This is because the structure of WPA-Enterprise is such that only each user can see his incoming or outgoing network connections. 

2. Our solution assumes that the user does not have any form of defence installed on his computer. (eg. no firewall that can prevent ARP spoofing, a network that does not use any enterprise level encryption, etc.) 

3. The attacks have only been tested to work for various users across the wireless network. While it might work on a network that uses a hub, it might not be possible to find a user to spoof on a network that uses switches, unless a wiretap is attached to the victim computer's LAN port.  

We hope to improve our solution for a more varied set of systems in the future. 

\section{Conclusion}
Through this project, we have learnt that ARP Spoofing is not easy to defend against. Even though there are solutions on the market that have been out for a while, unless one is using a network encrypted by WPA-Enterprise, it is otherwise easy to fall prey to such attacks. 

Furthermore, as active detection of ARP spoofing is not widely implemented yet, our solution may not be entirely foolproof. Thus, we will need to put in more work to make the solution more viable for a wider variety of situations.

%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
\section{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, we would like to thank Prof. Hugh Anderson for his guidance and patience with us throughout the semester. Our initial project was to investigate the hacking of Hello Barbie. However, we eventually decided to change the topic for various reasons, and he very kindly allowed us to do so. This is despite the topic being self-proposed and changed quite late in the semester. 

Our thanks also goes out to him for loaning us the Hello Barbie even though we eventually dropped the project. 

In addition, our appreciation also goes out to our friends who have loaned us various items for our project, such as a DLink Dir-825 router which runs on DD-RWT, so that we could work on the project in school.

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning, clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference
proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.

\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!
